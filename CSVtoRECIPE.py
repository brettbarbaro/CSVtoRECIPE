# import data from csv file - BRETT
# fill in missing data
#   Ingredients from proteomics:
#     Needs name (the name in the data you have)
#     Needs unique ID e.g. uniprot or ncbi (synthetic cell or http://wholecelldb.stanford.edu)
#     Needs the copy number of concentration (e.g. from mass spec, or http://wholecelldb.stanford.edu/ or david estimation from his painting...)
#     Fetch the sequence
#     Fetch or calculate  the molecular weight
#     From sequence retrieve a template from the PDB. Keep e-value and scoreâ€¦
#     Retrieve the multimer states for the structure using the PDB (biological assembly).
#     From sequence retrieve the localisation if unknow (e.g. cytoplasm, membrane etc,...)
#       http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/subcellular/
#       http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/pslpred/
#
#     From sequence and template from the PDB build an homology model (e.g. MODELLER or server license for MODELLER is MODELAJE in upper case)
#     If localisation is inner/outer membrane predict/retrieve the orientation of the structure  using http://opm.phar.umich.edu
#     Once a structure is known,
#       Load and center the atoms to the origin
#       apply k-means clustering based on number of atoms.
#       Generate a coarse molecular surface and save it as collada 1.4
#     Generate a recipe file in json.
#
#     Note:
#     http://wholecellkb.stanford.edu/list/Mgenitalium/ProteinComplex contains the mutlimeric states off all  proteins from mycoplasma genitalium. All entry are defined according the gene name (MG_001->MG_526). However for each gene there is a link to the uniprort.
#     Example code are in the github repo of autopack in the script folder
#     For ncbi access the fasta sequence can be done with
#     http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/296456015?report=fasta&log$=seqview&format=text#

# export results as json
print "hello"
